		<h1>Brazilian Soccer</h1>
		<p>soccer is the most popular sport in Brazil. The Brazilian national soccer team has won the FIFA World Cup tournament a record five times, in 1958, 1962, 1970, 1994 and 2002,[1] and is the only team to succeed in qualifying for every World Cup competition ever held. It is among the favorites to win the trophy every time the competition is scheduled. After Brazil won its 3rd World Cup in 1970, they were awarded the Jules Rimet Trophy permanently. But 365 days before World Cup 2014 begins, Brazil's rank dropped to 22nd, an all-time-low position.[2]</p>

<p>Pelé, arguably the greatest player ever, led Brazil to three of those championships and is the top scorer of all time in the sport. All of the leading players in the national teams are prominent in the soccer world, including Garrincha, Cafu, Roberto Carlos, Romário, Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Ronaldinho, and Kaká in the men's game, and Marta in the women's game. Some of these players can be considered super-stars, achieving celebrity status internationally and signing sports contracts, as well as advertisement and endorsement contracts, in the value of millions of euros.</p>

<p>soccer is taken very seriously in Brazil.[3] During the World Cup workers pause from their duties to watch their team in action;[3] even banks shut down three hours before matches to allow their workers time to prepare for the game.[3]</p>

<p>The governing body of soccer in Brazil is the Brazilian soccer Confederation. Brazil will host the 2014 FIFA World Cup.[3]</p>
